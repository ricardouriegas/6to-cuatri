# Processes Management
## What is a process?
A process is just a code that is being executed by the System. When you open a program, it starts a process. When you close the program, the process ends.

Now, a process can have multiple threads, which are smaller processes that run inside the main process, they are called threads or child processes.

- `top`: Display Linux processes.
- `htop`: Interactive process viewer.
- `kill`: Send a signal to a process.
- `killall`: Kill a group of processes by name.
- `pkill`: Send a signal to a process based on name.
- `pgrep`: List processes by name.
- `nice`: Run a command with modified scheduling priority.
- `renice`: Alter priority of running processes.
- `nohup`: Run a command immune to hangups.
- `bg`: Put a job in the background.
- `fg`: Bring a job to the foreground.

echo "To close top press q"
echo "Process for the firt sleep ID: $id"

# wait 5 seconds before running the next command
sleep 5
